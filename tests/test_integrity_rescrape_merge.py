"""Choosing "delete & rescrape" must not discard the confirmations already given.

The integrity check runs at the very end of confirm_and_save_changes, after
the user has answered every approval prompt for the whole run. When one
series trips a critical mismatch and the user picks "delete index & rescrape",
that decision concerns *that series only* -- every other approval in the run
(new episodes, newly watched, removed seasons) was still given and still
belongs in the index.

Observed live: a full scrape read Siren's Kiss as 12/12 watched, the user
approved it, Futurama tripped the critical check, the user chose to rescrape
it -- and Siren's Kiss stayed at 7/12 in the index. The following two scrapes
re-detected and re-prompted for the same changes, because they had never been
saved. The three index backups on disk (7/12, 7/12, 7/12, then 12/12 only
after a separate single-link run) record exactly that.

Run with:  python -m unittest discover -s tests
