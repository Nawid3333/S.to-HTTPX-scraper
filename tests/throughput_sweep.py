"""Find the worker count where the site, not this program, sets the pace.

Read-only diagnostic, in the same spirit as probe_cache_headers.py. It logs in
once per transport, then scrapes the SAME random sample of series again and
again with different settings, using the scraper's own _scrape_one_series --
the exact code a real run uses -- and reports what each setting achieved.
Nothing is written to the index, the checkpoint or the failed list; only its
own report file.

Run from the project root:

    python tests/throughput_sweep.py
    python tests/throughput_sweep.py --workers 4,8,12,16,24 --transport h2,h1 --sample 150 --repeats 2
    python tests/throughput_sweep.py --season-concurrency 2,4,8 --workers 8
    python tests/throughput_sweep.py --line-mbit 100

What it measures, per setting
-----------------------------
  pages/s      every page the site served, series + season pages. A 429 or a
               5xx is a refusal or a failure, not a page.
  series/s     what a real run's progress bar would show
  Mbit/s       bytes actually received (compressed, as they crossed the wire),
               to compare with your line speed
  ttfb p50/p90 time until the site starts answering. When this grows in step
               with the number of requests in flight while pages/s stays flat,
               the requests are waiting in a queue ON THE SITE: more workers
               only make the queue longer.
  body p50/p90 time from the headers to the last byte of the page. When this is
               what grows instead, the bytes themselves are waiting: on a full
               home line, or on a site that streams the page as it builds it.
               --line-mbit (your measured download speed) tells the two apart:
               a plateau at 70% of it or more is the line, not the site.
  429/503      the site explicitly pushing back
  cpu          this process's share of one CPU core. Near 100% means your PC
               (Python's single event loop) is the limit, not the site.
  idle         the share of worker time spent with nothing left to do: the
               queue ran dry and the worker waited for the others to finish. A
               long-running show can outlast every other worker; when much of
               a setting is spent like that, its pages/s says little about the
               worker count, and the setting needs a larger --sample.
  mismatch     series whose episode/watched counts differed from the first
               setting that scraped them -- speed must never cost accuracy.

Safety
------
A setting stops early when the site pushes back (429/503) or too many series
fail. In the default careful mode, every setting with at least as many
requests in flight (workers x season concurrency) is then skipped for that
transport: load only goes up from there. A transport whose warm-up series all
fail -- a login that did not take, a host that is down -- is not swept at all.
Settings are separated by a cool-down so one setting's load does not bleed
into the next, and each transport logs in only once -- repeated logins are
what made this site refuse logins before (see _acquire_client).

Whatever finished is saved even when the sweep is interrupted (Ctrl+C) or
crashes, marked "complete": false, so the load it put on the site is never
wasted.
