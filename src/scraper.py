    Takes the raw HTML rather than a soup: building a BeautifulSoup tree
    measured most of this function's cost, and the event loop was spending a

    that time overlaps with nothing). Going straight to lxml is ~4.4x faster
    on real season pages. Output is unchanged: verified against the recorded
    output of the previous implementation over 553 pages and 8,305 episodes,
    including the fallback branches that only synthetic markup reaches.

    Uses s.to-specific selectors:
      - Table: .episode-table tbody tr.episode-row

      - Title (EN): .episode-title-eng

    Falls back to generic selectors if primary ones fail.

        was found but genuinely holds no rows -- a season listed in the nav
        before its episodes are uploaded. That is a real state (four such
